# ALL-USE iAI Project: Implementation Plan (v2)

## 1. Introduction and Project Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for rebuilding the ALL-USE system using the iAI (intelligent Agent Interaction) Framework. The goal is to create a robust, modular, configurable, and maintainable financial trading and investment platform that aligns with the vision detailed in the `docs/ALL_USE_Story_Screenplay_Mode_v3.md` and `docs/all-use-development-guide-screenplay-claude_v3.md`.

This plan is designed for a human Project Lead (Command Center Operator) working in conjunction with an AI Co-pilot (e.g., Manus). Each phase will be driven by a detailed `implementation_prompt.md` and will result in an `implementation_response_from_AI.md` along with specified deliverables (typically design documents or code).

The project will follow the Build-Deploy-Test (BDT) methodology as outlined in `docs/BDTFramework.md` (updated version for iAI).

**Key Guiding Documents:**

*   `docs/all_use_iai_repo_structure_proposal_v2.md` (Defines the overall workstream and phase structure)
*   `docs/technical_architecture.md` (Updated version)
*   `docs/Cloud_Migration_and_Deployment_Architecture.md` (Updated version)
*   `docs/ALL_USE_Business_Plan.md`
*   All `implementation_prompt.md` files within each phase directory.

## 2. Pre-requisites

1.  **GitHub Repository Setup:** The `all_use_iai_project` repository is set up, and the AI Co-pilot has authenticated access.
2.  **Core Documentation Migration & Update:** Key existing documentation has been migrated to `all_use_iai_project/docs/` and updated to reflect the iAI framework and rebuild goals (as completed in previous steps).
3.  **Workstream & Phase Structure Creation:** The directory structure for all workstreams and phases has been created in the repository (as completed in previous steps).
4.  **Initial Implementation Prompts Drafted:** All `implementation_prompt.md` files for each phase have been drafted and are located in their respective phase directories (as completed in previous steps).

## 3. Execution Steps (Workstream by Workstream)

This section details the execution flow. For each phase, the Project Lead will:

1.  Review the `implementation_prompt.md` for the current phase.
2.  Assign the task to the AI Co-pilot.
3.  Review the AI Co-pilot_s `implementation_response_from_AI.md` and all deliverables.
4.  Ensure deliverables meet verification criteria and are committed to the repository.
5.  Proceed to the next phase.

## 4. Iteration and Refinement

This implementation plan is a living document. As the project progresses, insights from completed phases may necessitate adjustments to subsequent phases or prompts. The Command Center Operator and AI Co-pilot will collaboratively manage these refinements, ensuring all changes are documented and aligned with the overall project goals.

## 5. Next Steps (Post-Plan Approval)

Upon approval of this plan, the Project Lead will commence with Workstream 00, Phase 00.01.
