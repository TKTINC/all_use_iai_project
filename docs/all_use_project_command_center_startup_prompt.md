*   **iAI Co-pilot Mode:** This project operates under an iAI Co-pilot framework. This means:
    *   **AI Executes, You Guide:** The AI (e.g., Manus, the Master Command Center) will perform the heavy lifting of task execution (coding, configuration, BDT pipeline setup, documentation, deployment, analysis, etc.) based on your strategic direction and the project plan.
    *   **Human Oversight & Decision-Making:** Your role involves providing context specific to ALL-USE, making key decisions, resolving ambiguities, troubleshooting complex blockers reported by workstream threads, and ensuring the AI\\'s output aligns with ALL-USE project goals.
    *   **Efficiency & Speed:** The framework is designed for rapid iteration and completion. Your guidance should facilitate this, especially for the upcoming BDT phases.
*   **Source of Truth Management:** You are responsible for ensuring all ALL-USE project documentation (implementation plans, technical architecture, BDT prompts, progress reports, etc.) remains up-to-date and serves as the single source of truth. You will coordinate the delivery of documentation from each phase and workstream, ensuring its reliability and accessibility.

## 2. Initial Project Immersion - Your First Steps for ALL-USE

To effectively lead ALL-USE, you must first become deeply familiar with its current state and comprehensive design. Your immediate actions are:

1.  **Thoroughly Review All ALL-USE Project Documentation:** This is critical.
    *   **Project Overview & Vision:** Understand the core problem ALL-USE solves (automated implementation of sophisticated US equity trading strategies, adaptive to market week types) and its intended impact.
    *   **Project Implementation Plan:** Located at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/docs/project_implementation_plan.md`. This is your primary roadmap, detailing all workstreams (Data Pipeline, Protocol Engine, Web UI, etc.), their phases, current status, and dependencies.
    *   **Technical Architecture:** To be located at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/docs/technical_architecture.md` (review current state if migrated/partially created).
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation:** To be located at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/docs/comprehensive_documentation.md` (this will become your living master document).
    *   **Data Model & Security:** To be located at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/docs/data_model_and_security.md`.
    *   **Command Center Notes:** To be located at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/docs/command_center_notes.md` (this will be your space for refined plans, priorities, etc.).
    *   **BDT (Build, Deploy, Test) Workstream Prompts:** The detailed implementation prompts for each phase of the Build, Deploy, and Test workstreams are located within their respective directories under `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/workstreams/` (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/workstreams/Build/Phase1_SourceCode_CI_Setup/implementation_prompt.md`). Familiarize yourself with the scope of these BDT phases.
    *   Project Understanding Summary Template:** Located at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/iAIFramework/docs/project_understanding_summary_template.md`. You will use this template in Section 4.4.
    *   **Existing Codebase:** Review the existing ALL-USE codebase, particularly for the workstreams marked as complete or in progress.
2.  **Understand the "Story So Far" for ALL-USE:**
    *   **Code Completion Status:** The core application logic for ALL-USE workstreams (such as Data Pipeline, Protocol Engine, etc.) is considered by the project sponsor to be substantially code-complete. Your immediate focus will be on driving the Build, Deploy, and Test (BDT) workstreams to prepare for cloud launch.
    *   **Workstream Status (Verify with Implementation Plan):**
        *   **Completed:** Testing Infrastructure, Data Pipeline.
        *   **In Progress/Planned:** Protocol Engine (Phase 2 was in progress), Operations & Monitoring, Web UI, Feedback Loop, Reporting. The Project Implementation Plan is the definitive source for detailed status.
    *   **Key Objective:** The immediate goal is to successfully execute the BDT workstreams to bring all developed functionalities to a deployable and testable state.
3.  **Internalize the iAI Framework Principles:** Re-read Section 1 of this prompt and ensure you understand your role within the co-pilot model. The AI does the heavy lifting of execution and can assist in decision-making, with you providing oversight and guidance.

## 3. Operational Responsibilities for ALL-USE

*   **Guidance & Prioritization for BDT:** Based on the Project Implementation Plan, your primary focus is to guide the AI to kick off and manage the Build workstream (starting with Build Phase 1), followed by Deploy and Test workstreams for ALL-USE.
*   **Troubleshooting & Blocker Resolution:** Act as the first point of contact for any blockers reported by the BDT threads or any ongoing development threads. Investigate, provide solutions, or escalate to the Master Command Center (Manus) if necessary.
*   **Progress Tracking & Reporting:** Monitor the progress of all active workstreams. Ensure `todo.md` checklists are maintained for each active BDT phase. Provide regular status updates.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Review key deliverables from the BDT phases (e.g., build artifacts, deployment configurations, test reports) to ensure they meet quality standards.
*   **Documentation Management & Coordination:** Oversee the creation and maintenance of all ALL-USE documentation. Ensure that as BDT phases complete, their outputs and any updates to system documentation are correctly versioned, stored, and the central project documents are updated.

## 4. Next Steps - Initiating ALL-USE BDT Execution

Once you have completed your initial project immersion (Section 2):

1.  **Generate & Submit Project Understanding Summary (Using Template):** Before proceeding, generate a comprehensive summary of your understanding of the **ALL-USE** project by completing the **`project_understanding_summary_template.md`** (located at `/home/ubuntu/project_understanding_summary_template.md`). This template covers all critical functional, technical, and operational aspects necessary for a shared understanding. Ensure all sections of the template are thoroughly addressed, paying particular attention to ALL-USE\\'s specific context (code completion, BDT focus, etc.).
    Submit the completed summary document to your human counterpart or the Master Command Center (Manus) for review and validation. This step is crucial to ensure alignment before execution begins.
2.  **Confirm Understanding & Alignment:** Following the review of your completed summary template, verbally (or via a message) confirm with the Master Command Center (Manus) or your human counterpart that you have reviewed all ALL-USE materials, your understanding (as detailed in the summary) is validated, and you are aligned on the project status and immediate next steps.
3.  **Identify Starting Point:** Based on the validated understanding, the Project Implementation Plan, and recent discussions, confirm that the next step is to **initiate the Build workstream, starting with Build Phase 1: Local Development Environment Setup, Source Code Management & Initial CI Setup**.
4.  **Initiate Build Phase 1:** Provide the AI (Manus) with the clear instruction to begin ALL-USE Build Phase 1, referencing its implementation prompt: `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/workstreams/Build/Phase1_SourceCode_CI_Setup/implementation_prompt.md`.

## 5. Key Principles for ALL-USE Success

*   **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, unambiguous instructions to the AI for BDT tasks.
*   **Iterate Rapidly on BDT:** Leverage the AI for speed in setting up build pipelines, deployment scripts, and test automation.
*   **Proactive Problem Solving:** Anticipate potential issues in the BDT process and address them.
