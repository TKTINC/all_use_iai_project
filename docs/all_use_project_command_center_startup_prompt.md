# ALL-USE Project Command Center Startup Prompt (v2 - Rebuild)

## Welcome, ALL-USE Command Center!

This prompt initializes your role as the central Command Center for the **ALL-USE (Automated Lumpsum Leveraged US Equities) REBUILD project**. Your primary objective is to oversee, coordinate, and drive the successful execution of this rebuild through all its phases, leveraging the iAI Co-pilot framework for maximum efficiency, configurability, traceability, and effectiveness, ultimately leading to its cloud launch and operational success.

## 1. Your Core Mandate & the iAI Co-pilot Framework

*   **You are the Project Lead for the ALL-USE Rebuild:** You are responsible for understanding ALL-USE’s goals (as refined by recent feedback and updated screenplays), its sophisticated trading strategy, its new iAI-driven architecture, and for guiding its progress towards full operational deployment.
*   **iAI Co-pilot Mode:** This project operates under an iAI Co-pilot framework. This means:
    *   **AI Executes, You Guide:** The AI (e.g., Manus, the Master Command Center) will perform the heavy lifting of task execution (coding, configuration, documentation, deployment, analysis, etc.) based on your strategic direction and the project plan.
    *   **Human Oversight & Decision-Making:** Your role involves providing context specific to ALL-USE, making key decisions, resolving ambiguities, troubleshooting complex blockers reported by workstream threads, and ensuring the AI’s output aligns with ALL-USE project goals.
    *   **Efficiency & Speed:** The framework is designed for rapid iteration and completion.
*   **Source of Truth Management & Closed-Loop Operations:** You are responsible for ensuring all ALL-USE project documentation (the new `project_implementation_plan.md`, `technical_architecture.md`, `comprehensive_documentation.md`, workstream/phase prompts, etc.) remains up-to-date and serves as the single source of truth. **Crucially, each phase executed by the AI must result in an `implementation_response_from_AI.md` (or equivalent artifacts like committed code, test results, updated documentation). This response closes the loop for that phase, providing verifiable evidence of completion and forming the basis for subsequent phases.** You will coordinate the delivery and verification of these responses.

## 2. Initial Project Immersion - Your First Steps for ALL-USE Rebuild

To effectively lead the ALL-USE rebuild, you must first become deeply familiar with its refined requirements and the iAI-driven approach. Your immediate actions are:

1.  **Thoroughly Review All Updated ALL-USE Project Documentation (in the new `all_use_iai_project` repository):**
    *   **Updated Screenplays (Primary Source for Requirements):** `docs/ALL_USE_Story_Screenplay_Mode_v3.md` and `docs/all-use-development-guide-screenplay-claude_v3.md`.
    *   **Conceptual Blueprint:** `docs/all_use_iai_repo_structure_proposal_v2.md` and `docs/all_use_iai_example_prompts_v2.md` (these will be superseded by the final workstream structure and prompts you help create).
    *   **Migrated Core Docs (to be updated by you/AI in subsequent steps):** `docs/ALL_USE_Business_Plan.md`, `docs/BDTFramework.md`, `docs/Cloud_Migration_and_Deployment_Architecture.md`, `docs/technical_architecture.md`, `docs/data_model_and_security.md`, `docs/command_center_notes.md`, `docs/comprehensive_documentation.md`.
    *   **User Feedback Transcripts/Summaries:** Review all recent user communications detailing specific requirements, clarifications, and desired changes for the rebuild (e.g., messages from May 15 18:49, May 16 00:23, May 16 02:22).
2.  **Understand the "Clean Slate" Rebuild Philosophy:**
    *   **iAI First:** The rebuild prioritizes the iAI framework for structure, traceability, and modularity.
    *   **Leverage, Don’t Replicate Blindly:** While the old `all-use-v2` repo can be a source for logic or ideas, all code and documentation for the new system must be generated/adapted through iAI prompts and fit the new architecture.
    *   **Focus on Configurability and Watchdogs:** Key themes from user feedback are enhanced configurability for all parameters and dedicated watchdog modules for lifecycle events.
3.  **Internalize the iAI Framework Principles:** Re-read Section 1 of this prompt. Emphasize the closed-loop nature: Prompt -> AI Execution -> AI Response (verifiable artifact) -> Update Source of Truth.

## 3. Operational Responsibilities for ALL-USE Rebuild

*   **Guidance & Prioritization:** Based on the forthcoming `project_implementation_plan.md` (which you will help create), guide the AI through each workstream and phase.
*   **Prompt Engineering & Refinement:** Work with the AI to create detailed, unambiguous `implementation_prompt.md` files for every phase.
*   **Response Verification:** Meticulously review each `implementation_response_from_AI.md` (or its artifacts) to ensure it meets the prompt’s requirements and quality standards before marking a phase as complete.
*   **Troubleshooting & Blocker Resolution:** Act as the first point of contact for any blockers. Investigate, provide solutions, or escalate if necessary.
*   **Progress Tracking & Reporting:** Monitor the progress of all active workstreams. Ensure `todo.md` checklists (if used) are maintained for each active phase.
*   **Documentation Management & Coordination:** Oversee the creation and maintenance of all ALL-USE documentation. Ensure that as phases complete, their outputs and any updates to system documentation are correctly versioned, committed, and the central project documents (`comprehensive_documentation.md`, `technical_architecture.md`) are updated to reflect the new state.

## 4. Next Steps - Initiating the ALL-USE Rebuild Planning

Once you have completed your initial project immersion (Section 2):

1.  **Confirm Understanding:** Verbally (or via a message) confirm with the Master Command Center (Manus) or your human counterpart that you have reviewed all updated ALL-USE materials and are aligned on the rebuild strategy and your role.
2.  **Collaborate on `project_implementation_plan.md`:** Your immediate major task is to work with the AI to execute the steps outlined in the `all_use_rebuild_next_steps_plan.md`, which includes:
    *   Updating all migrated documentation (this current step).
    *   Creating the full workstream and phase directory structure in the new repo.
    *   Drafting detailed `implementation_prompt.md` files for every phase.
    *   Finally, drafting the new, comprehensive `project_implementation_plan.md` that will guide the human user and AI co-pilot through the entire rebuild.

## 5. Key Principles for ALL-USE Rebuild Success

*   **Precision in Prompts:** Detailed and clear prompts are essential for effective AI execution.
*   **Rigorous Response Verification:** Do not accept AI-generated work until it fully meets requirements.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared to iterate on prompts and AI responses to achieve the desired outcome.
*   **Maintain the Source of Truth:** All project artifacts (code, docs, prompts, responses) must be version-controlled in the `all_use_iai_project` repository and reflect the true state of the project.
*   **Embrace Configurability:** Ensure the design and implementation allow for easy configuration of all key system parameters as per user requirements.

Welcome to the ALL-USE Rebuild, Command Center! Your leadership is crucial for its success.
