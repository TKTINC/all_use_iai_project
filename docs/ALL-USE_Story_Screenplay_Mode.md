# ALL-USE: The Full Story — Screenplay Mode

---

### 🎬 Scene 1: The Origin
**Setting:** A founder opens an Interactive Brokers (IBKR) account.

**Narration:**
> “This is no ordinary brokerage account. It’s the seed of an engine — a machine that grows capital, pays monthly income, and compounds into long-term wealth. Welcome to ALL-USE.”

**Action:**
> The $1,000,000 account is split into three sub-accounts:
> - 40% → **Gen-Acc** (Generator)
> - 30% → **Rev-Acc** (Revenue)
> - 30% → **Com-Acc** (Compounding)
>
> (**EDIT : leave out 5% in each account type as cash buffer.....**)

**Intent:**
> “Each account plays a distinct role. Together, they form a system of self-reinforcing growth.”

---

### 🎬 Scene 2: Roles and Intent
**Focus: The three accounts.**

**Gen-Acc:**
> - Weekly ATM wheel strategy (40–50 delta CSPs and CCs on TSLA, NVDA)
> - Premium harvested on Mon/Thu via 0DTE/1DTE entries
> - Target 3–4% monthly post-tax
> - Reinvested weekly into additional contracts
> - Surplus > $50K? Fork a new account (50% to Gen, 50% to Com)

**Rev-Acc:**
> - Income-stable wheel (**EDIT : 30–40** delta OTM on AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG)
> - Target 2–3% monthly post-tax
> - Quarterly reinvestment (75% new contracts, 25% LEAPS)
> - Income stream optional post Year 3
> - Forks into $500K accounts (if growth sustains)

**Com-Acc:**

> - Long-hold compounding engine using shares + LEAPS
> - 2% monthly from options + dynamic annual stock move
> - Quarterly reinvestment (75% shares, 25% LEAPS)
> - **No withdrawals**
> - **Merge Rule**: Any forked account reaching $500K is absorbed here

---

### 🎬 Scene 3: The Weekly Routine
**Every Monday morning:**
> - Classify week: **Green**, **Red**, or **Chop** based on volatility and trend (EDIT: Can this be done based off of prev week, market charts etc....actually we should have a guess at week-start and confirmation at week-end...this way we build data that tells us if we are guessing what % of weeks correctly. This is similar to our week-type classification where we start with post trade but eventually start having pre-trade notiion of the week-type)
> - Adjust strike/delta selection accordingly (Only the strikes and deltas to be adjusted, not the trade size)

**Trade Entry:**
> - Gen-Acc enters ATM CSPs or CCs (40-50 delta). - Entry Only on Thursdays
> - Rev-Acc enters safer OTM (30–40 delta) - Entry on Mondays through Wednesdays....

**Mid-week Adjustments:**

> - Apply **ATR Protocol**: Adjust based on price movement, IV changes, delta shifts
> - Roll, double-down, or exit early depending on PnL% rules

**Friday Close:**

> - All contracts settled or rolled
> - Profits recorded

---

### 🎬 Scene 4: Reinvestments & Forking
**Every Quarter:**
> - Tally post-tax net gains
> - Apply reinvestment logic per account
> - If Gen-Acc has >$50K surplus → fork new account
> - Forked accounts follow same weekly flow (50% Gen-Acc and 50% Com-Acc)

**Fork Merge Logic:**
> - If any forked account(combined gen-acc and com-acc) crosses $500K → fully merge it into Com-Acc

---

### 🎬 Scene 5: Tracking & Feedback
**Live Data Capture:**
> - Option chain snapshots daily
> - Trade logs per account
> - Tax ledger updated monthly

**Feedback Loop:**
> - Past trade data → improves strike prediction
> - Rolling edge cases → generate rule updates
> - UI visuals: account growth, forks, PnL trees

---

### 🎬 Scene 6: Reporting & Analysis
**Every Week:**
> - Trade summary
> - Missed opportunities (? Not sure we need this yet....pass for now)
> - Income earned
> - ATR adjustments used

**Every Month:**
> - Income vs reinvestment
> - New forks triggered
> - Corpus growth per account
> - Tax deductions estimated

---

### 🎬 Scene 7: 1-Year and Beyond
**Milestones:**
> - 3-month checkpoint: Is income compounding?
> - 6-month checkpoint: Are forks aligned with protocol?
> - Year 1 checkpoint: Is Rev-Acc ready for income extraction?
> - Year 3 checkpoint: Multiple Com-Acc forks merged, passive yield growing

**Closing Narration:**
> “ALL-USE is not a strategy. It’s a system. One designed not just to perform, but to endure. It makes wealth predictable — not by beating the market, but by outlasting it, outcompounding it, and out-automating it.”
