# ALL-USE Cloud Migration and Deployment Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the cloud migration strategy and target deployment architecture for the ALL-USE (Automated Lumpsum Leveraged US Equities) system. It complements the `technical_architecture.md` and the `BDTFramework.md` by focusing on how ALL-USE components will be deployed, managed, and scaled in a cloud environment.

**System Overview:** ALL-USE is an automated trading system with multiple components including a Data Pipeline, Protocol Engine, Web UI, Operations & Monitoring, Reporting, and a Feedback Loop. Its architecture is service-oriented, making it well-suited for cloud-native deployment patterns.

**Goals for Cloud Deployment:**
-   **Scalability:** Ability to scale resources up or down based on demand (e.g., market data volume, user traffic, processing load).
-   **High Availability & Reliability:** Ensure the system is resilient to failures and maintains high uptime, especially for critical trading operations.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimize cloud resource usage to manage operational costs.
-   **Security:** Implement robust security measures at all layers of the cloud infrastructure.
-   **Manageability:** Simplify deployment, monitoring, and maintenance operations.

## 2. Current State & Migration Strategy (If Applicable)

-   **Current State:** As per the `project_implementation_plan.md`, ALL-USE development has progressed significantly, with some components (Data Pipeline, Testing Infrastructure) considered complete and in maintenance mode. Initial development and testing might be occurring in local Dockerized environments or a preliminary cloud setup.
-   **Migration Strategy:** This document primarily focuses on the target cloud architecture. If migrating from an existing on-premises or different cloud setup, a phased migration approach would be adopted:
    1.  **Lift and Shift (Initial):** Potentially move existing Dockerized components to cloud VMs or basic container services with minimal changes to get a foothold in the cloud.
    2.  **Re-platform/Re-factor (Iterative):** Gradually adapt components to leverage cloud-native services (e.g., managed databases, serverless functions, managed Kubernetes) for better scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

## 3. Target Cloud Platform

-   **Preferred Cloud Provider:** To be decided (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). The choice will depend on factors like existing team expertise, specific service offerings, pricing, and integration capabilities with tools like IBKR (Interactive Brokers).
-   **Rationale:** The selected provider should offer a comprehensive suite of services including robust compute (VMs, containers, serverless), storage (object, block, file), databases (relational, NoSQL, time-series), networking (VPCs, load balancers, DNS), and security services.

## 4. Target Deployment Architecture

Based on the `technical_architecture.md`, the ALL-USE system will be deployed using a container-centric approach, orchestrated by Kubernetes (or a similar managed container orchestration service).

### 4.1. Compute Layer

-   **Containerization:** All ALL-USE services (Data Pipeline components, Protocol Engine, Web UI backend, Reporting services, Feedback Loop components) will be packaged as Docker containers.
-   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) will be used for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
    -   Each service will be deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment/StatefulSet.
    -   Services will expose themselves via Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer).
-   **Serverless Functions (Optional):** For specific event-driven tasks or highly intermittent workloads (e.g., certain data processing steps in the Data Pipeline, notification services), serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) might be used to optimize cost and scalability.

### 4.2. Data Storage Layer

-   **Time-Series Database:** Managed InfluxDB or a cloud provider's equivalent (e.g., Amazon Timestream, Google Cloud Monitoring for metrics if applicable) for storing market data and system metrics.
-   **Relational Database:** Managed PostgreSQL (e.g., Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) for metadata, processed features, user configurations, and reporting data.
-   **Object Storage:** (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) for storing raw data, logs, build artifacts, backups, and potentially frontend static assets.
-   **Messaging/Streaming:** Managed Kafka (e.g., Amazon MSK, Confluent Cloud on the chosen provider) if high-volume real-time data processing is a core requirement for the Data Pipeline or Protocol Engine.

### 4.3. Networking Layer

-   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** A dedicated VPC will be created to isolate ALL-USE resources.
-   **Subnets:** Public and private subnets will be used to control network access to resources.
    -   Public subnets for internet-facing resources like load balancers for the Web UI.
    -   Private subnets for backend services, databases, and internal components.
-   **Load Balancers:** Application Load Balancers (ALBs) or Network Load Balancers (NLBs) will distribute traffic to the Web UI and potentially other API endpoints.
-   **API Gateway (Optional):** An API Gateway service could be used to manage, secure, and expose APIs from the Protocol Engine or Reporting services.
-   **DNS:** Managed DNS services (e.g., Amazon Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS) for domain name resolution.
-   **Firewalls/Security Groups/Network ACLs:** To control inbound and outbound traffic at various levels.

### 4.4. Web UI Deployment

-   **Frontend:** The React frontend will be built into static assets.
    -   **Option 1 (Object Storage + CDN):** Deploy static assets to Object Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) and serve them via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for low latency and high availability.
    -   **Option 2 (Containerized Web Server):** Serve static assets from a lightweight web server (e.g., Nginx) running in a container within Kubernetes, behind a load balancer.
-   **Backend APIs:** The Web UI will communicate with backend APIs (Protocol Engine, Reporting) exposed via load balancers or an API Gateway.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline for Cloud Deployment

As outlined in the `BDTFramework.md`:
-   **Source Code:** GitHub.
-   **CI/CD Tool:** GitHub Actions.
-   **Build:** Docker images built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry).
-   **Deploy:** GitHub Actions will trigger deployments to Kubernetes environments (Dev, Staging, Production) using tools like `kubectl`, Helm, or Kustomize.
    -   Secrets will be managed securely (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider's secret manager) and injected into containers at runtime.
    -   Environment-specific configurations will be applied during deployment.

## 6. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting

-   **Metrics:** Prometheus deployed within Kubernetes (or a managed Prometheus service) to scrape metrics from applications and infrastructure.
-   **Dashboards:** Grafana for visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
-   **Logging:** Centralized logging using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud provider's managed logging service (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor Logs). Applications will write logs to stdout/stderr, collected by the container runtime and forwarded.
-   **Alerting:** Prometheus Alertmanager or cloud provider's alerting services integrated with PagerDuty/OpsGenie for incident notification.

## 7. Security Considerations

-   **Network Security:** VPCs, private subnets, security groups, Network ACLs, Web Application Firewall (WAF) for public-facing endpoints.
-   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Principle of least privilege for all cloud resources and service accounts.
-   **Data Encryption:**
    -   Encryption at rest for databases and object storage (using managed keys).
    -   Encryption in transit using TLS/SSL for all communications.
-   **Secrets Management:** Secure storage and rotation of API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.
-   **Vulnerability Management:** Regular scanning of container images and infrastructure components.
-   **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant financial regulations and data privacy laws (to be further investigated and implemented based on specific requirements).

## 8. Scalability and High Availability

-   **Kubernetes:** Auto-scaling of pods (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and nodes (Cluster Autoscaler).
-   **Managed Services:** Leverage auto-scaling and high-availability features of managed databases, load balancers, and other cloud services.
-   **Multi-AZ Deployments:** Deploy critical components across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for resilience.
-   **Stateless Services:** Design backend services to be stateless where possible to simplify scaling.

## 9. Cost Management

-   **Resource Tagging:** Tag all cloud resources for cost tracking and allocation.
-   **Right-Sizing:** Regularly review and adjust resource allocations to match demand.
-   **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans:** Utilize cost-saving options for long-running workloads.
-   **Spot Instances (Optional):** Consider for fault-tolerant batch processing workloads.
-   **Monitoring Budgets and Alerts:** Set up cloud provider budget alerts.

## 10. Future Evolution

-   **Global Expansion:** If ALL-USE needs to serve users in different geographic regions, a multi-region deployment strategy might be considered.
-   **Advanced Disaster Recovery (DR):** Implement more sophisticated DR strategies (e.g., pilot light, warm standby, multi-site active/active) if RTO/RPO requirements become very stringent.

This document provides a foundational plan for ALL-USE's cloud deployment. It will be a living document, updated as the project evolves and specific implementation details are finalized.
