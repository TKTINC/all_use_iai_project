# ALL-USE Cloud Migration and Deployment Architecture (v2 - iAI Rebuild)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the cloud migration strategy and target deployment architecture for the **ALL-USE (Automated Lumpsum Leveraged US Equities) REBUILD project**. It complements the forthcoming updated `technical_architecture.md` and the `BDTFramework.md (v2 - iAI Rebuild)` by focusing on how ALL-USE components will be deployed, managed, and scaled in a cloud environment, **driven by iAI principles and phases**.

**System Overview (Rebuild Context):** ALL-USE, in its rebuilt form, will be an automated trading system with a modular architecture. Key components include a Data Pipeline, a highly configurable Protocol Engine (with distinct Gen-Acc, Rev-Acc, Com-Acc strategy modules), Account Lifecycle Watchdogs (for forking, merging, reinvestment), a Web UI, Operations & Monitoring, Reporting, Compliance modules, and a Feedback Loop for adaptive trading. Its architecture is designed for cloud-native deployment.

**Goals for Cloud Deployment (iAI Driven):**
-   **Scalability:** Ability to scale resources based on demand, with scaling strategies implemented via iAI phases.
-   **High Availability & Reliability:** Ensure resilience and high uptime, with HA configurations defined and deployed via iAI phases.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimize cloud resource usage, with cost optimization strategies considered in relevant iAI deployment phases.
-   **Security & Compliance:** Implement robust security measures and compliance controls at all layers, with specific iAI phases dedicated to security and compliance setup.
-   **Manageability:** Simplify deployment, monitoring, and maintenance operations, leveraging automation through iAI-driven BDT processes.

## 2. Migration Strategy (Clean Slate for Rebuild)

-   **Current State:** The ALL-USE rebuild starts from a new repository (`all_use_iai_project`) with a focus on iAI-driven development. There is no direct migration of an existing running system; rather, it is a fresh deployment of a newly architected system.
-   **Deployment Strategy:** The system will be deployed to the cloud iteratively, workstream by workstream, or module by module, as components are developed and tested through the iAI framework. Each deployment step will be an iAI-managed phase.

## 3. Target Cloud Platform (To be confirmed via iAI Phase)

-   **Preferred Cloud Provider:** The choice of AWS, GCP, or Azure will be finalized as part of an early iAI phase within the `00_Project_Orchestration_And_Command_Center` or a dedicated infrastructure workstream. The decision will be based on factors like service offerings for financial applications, security, compliance certifications, cost, and integration capabilities (e.g., with IBKR).
-   **Rationale:** The selected provider must offer a comprehensive suite of services suitable for a secure, scalable, and compliant financial trading platform.

## 4. Target Deployment Architecture (iAI Implemented)

Based on the `all_use_iai_repo_structure_proposal_v2.md` and the principles of a modular, service-oriented architecture, the ALL-USE system will be deployed using a container-centric approach, likely orchestrated by Kubernetes. Each componentâ€™s deployment will be a distinct iAI phase.

### 4.1. Compute Layer (iAI Deployed Modules)

-   **Containerization:** All ALL-USE services (Data Pipeline modules, Protocol Engine components, Account Lifecycle Watchdogs, Web UI backend, Reporting services, etc.) will be packaged as Docker containers, with Dockerfiles generated and managed via iAI prompts.
-   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) is the preferred orchestrator. Its setup and configuration will be a dedicated iAI workstream/phase.
    -   Each microservice/module will be a Kubernetes Deployment/StatefulSet.
    -   Services exposed via Kubernetes Services.
-   **Serverless Functions (Considered in iAI Phases):** For specific event-driven tasks (e.g., alert notifications, specific data transformations), serverless functions may be designed and implemented via dedicated iAI phases.

### 4.2. Data Storage Layer (iAI Configured Services)

-   **Time-Series Database:** (e.g., Managed InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or cloud provider equivalent). Selection and schema design via iAI phases.
-   **Relational Database:** (e.g., Managed PostgreSQL). Schema (as defined in `data_model_and_security.md` and account entity phases) deployed and managed via iAI.
-   **Object Storage:** (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob). For logs, raw data, backups, artifacts. Usage policies defined via iAI.
-   **Messaging/Streaming (If Required):** (e.g., Managed Kafka). If needed for high-throughput data, its setup will be an iAI phase.

### 4.3. Networking Layer (iAI Secured Configuration)

-   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Dedicated VPC setup via an iAI phase.
-   **Subnets:** Public/private subnet design and implementation via iAI.
-   **Load Balancers & API Gateway:** Setup and configuration for UI and internal/external APIs via iAI phases.
-   **DNS & Firewalls/Security Groups/Network ACLs:** Configuration and management as part of iAI-driven network setup phases.

### 4.4. Web UI Deployment (iAI Managed Build & Deploy)

-   **Frontend:** React frontend built into static assets (iAI build phase).
-   **Deployment:** Static assets to Object Storage + CDN, or containerized Nginx (deployment strategy decided and implemented in an iAI phase).
-   **Backend APIs:** Securely exposed and accessed.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline for Cloud Deployment (iAI Orchestrated BDT)

As detailed in `BDTFramework.md (v2 - iAI Rebuild)`:
-   All CI/CD pipeline setup and configuration (GitHub Actions, container registry, deployment tools like `kubectl`/Helm) will be implemented through specific iAI phases within the BDT workstream.
-   Secure secret management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud KMS) integration will be a dedicated iAI phase.

## 6. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting (iAI Deployed & Configured)

-   **Metrics, Dashboards, Logging (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Cloud Native):** Setup, configuration, and integration of these tools will be managed through dedicated iAI phases.
-   **Alerting:** Configuration of alerts for system health, performance, security, and **critical trading operations (e.g., human-in-the-loop alerts for premium thresholds, protocol triggers)** will be defined and implemented via iAI prompts.

## 7. Security & Compliance Considerations (iAI Integrated)

-   **Comprehensive Security:** All aspects (Network Security, IAM, Data Encryption, Secrets Management, Vulnerability Management) will be addressed through dedicated iAI phases within a Security/Compliance workstream or integrated into relevant module deployment phases.
-   **Compliance by Design:** Adherence to financial regulations (FINRA, SEC) and data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) will be a core requirement. Specific iAI phases will be dedicated to implementing audit capabilities, data governance policies, and preparing for potential third-party assessments.

## 8. Scalability and High Availability (iAI Designed)

-   **Auto-scaling strategies** for Kubernetes and managed services will be designed and implemented via iAI phases.
-   **Multi-AZ deployments** for critical components will be standard, configured through iAI.

## 9. Cost Management (iAI Informed)

-   Resource tagging, right-sizing, and selection of cost-effective services (e.g., spot instances where appropriate) will be considerations within relevant iAI deployment and configuration prompts.

## 10. Future Evolution (iAI Adaptable)

-   The modular, iAI-driven architecture will facilitate future enhancements, such as global expansion or advanced DR, through new or updated iAI workstreams and phases.

This document will evolve as the ALL-USE rebuild progresses, with updates managed and version-controlled, reflecting the outputs of various iAI-driven implementation phases. Its role is to provide the high-level cloud strategy that subsequent iAI prompts will detail and execute.
