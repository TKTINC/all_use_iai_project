# ALL-USE Project Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

**Project Name:** ALL-USE (Automated Lumpsum Leveraged US Equities)

**Project Vision:** To develop an automated trading system that implements a sophisticated investment strategy for US equities. The system will use market analysis, week type classification, and adaptive trading strategies to optimize investment returns while managing risk. The core innovation is the ability to classify market weeks into different types and apply appropriate trading strategies based on the classification.

**Scope & Objectives:**
- Automate the implementation of sophisticated trading strategies.
- Optimize investment returns while managing risk.
- Adapt to changing market conditions through week type classification.
- Provide transparency and control through a Web UI.
- Ensure system reliability and performance through Operations & Monitoring.
- Enable continuous improvement through a Feedback Loop.
- Generate comprehensive reports for analysis and compliance.

This document outlines the plan for implementing the ALL-USE system in alignment with the iAI Co-pilot Framework.

## 3. Implementation Prompts

Detailed `implementation_prompt.md` files will be created for each phase within each workstream. These will be located in `[product_name]/workstreams/[workstream_name]/[phase_name]/implementation_prompt.md`.

## 4. Product-Specific Onboarding Prompt

A product-specific `onboarding_prompt.md` will be created and maintained at `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/onboarding_prompt.md`. This prompt will provide a concise summary of the ALL-USE project, its current status, vision, and direct links to key documentation within the iAI framework structure.

## 5. BDT (Build-Deploy-Test) Workstream

The **Testing Infrastructure** workstream (Section 2.1) largely covers the "Test" aspect. The "Build" and "Deploy" aspects will be integrated into each development workstream and managed through CI/CD pipelines.

- **Build Process:** Automated builds will be triggered upon code commits for each component.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Phased deployments (e.g., Dev, Staging, Production) will be implemented. Initial focus is on development and testing environments.
- **Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance tests as defined in the Testing Infrastructure workstream. Each new feature or component will require corresponding tests.

Detailed BDT processes and prompts will be further defined within the `command_center_notes.md` and relevant phase-specific implementation prompts.

## 6. Core Documentation Deliverables

The following core documents will be created and maintained in `/home/ubuntu/all-use-v2-temp/all-use/docs/`:

- **`technical_architecture.md`:** (To be migrated/created) Will detail the system architecture, components, technologies, and infrastructure.
- **`data_model_and_security.md`:** (To be drafted) Will describe data schemas, data flow, storage mechanisms, and security considerations.
- **`command_center_notes.md`:** (To be drafted) Will outline project coordination, refined implementation sequences, detailed prioritization, parallelization strategies, dependency management, checkpoints, and risk management.
- **`comprehensive_documentation.md`:** (To be created) Will serve as the living master document consolidating all key decisions and information.

## 7. Workstream Prioritization, Parallelization, and Dependencies

### 7.1. Prioritization:

1.  **Protocol Engine (Phase 2 - Current Priority):** Core business logic development is paramount.
2.  **Operations & Monitoring (High Priority - Next):** Essential for stability and reliability once Protocol Engine advances.
3.  **Web UI (Medium Priority):** Required for user interaction and system control.
4.  **Reporting (Medium Priority):** Needed for performance analysis and insights.
5.  **Feedback Loop (Medium Priority):** Crucial for long-term system optimization.
6.  **Testing Infrastructure & Data Pipeline (Maintenance):** Already complete but require ongoing maintenance and updates as other systems evolve.

### 7.2. Parallelization Strategy:

- Development of **Protocol Engine (Phase 2)** can occur in parallel with initial planning and design phases of **Operations & Monitoring**, **Web UI**, **Reporting**, and **Feedback Loop**.
- Once core infrastructure for Ops & Monitoring is ready, its development can parallelize further Protocol Engine work.
- Frontend (Web UI) and Backend (Protocol Engine, Reporting, Feedback Loop) development can be parallelized once APIs and data contracts are defined.

### 7.3. Module/Component Dependencies:

- **Protocol Engine** depends on: Data Pipeline (complete).
- **Operations & Monitoring** depends on: Data from all workstreams, particularly Protocol Engine and Data Pipeline.
- **Web UI** depends on: Protocol Engine (for signals, data), Operations & Monitoring (for alerts), Reporting (for displaying reports).
- **Feedback Loop** depends on: Reporting (for performance data), Protocol Engine (to send optimization parameters), Testing Infrastructure (for A/B testing).
- **Reporting** depends on: Data from all workstreams, especially Protocol Engine and Data Pipeline.
