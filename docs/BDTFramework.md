# ALL-USE Build-Deploy-Test (BDT) Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Build, Deploy, and Test (BDT) framework for the ALL-USE (Automated Lumpsum Leveraged US Equities) project. It defines the processes, workstreams, phases, and key considerations for ensuring high-quality, reliable, and efficient software delivery. This framework is aligned with the iAI Co-pilot Framework and the specific needs of the ALL-USE system, as detailed in its `technical_architecture.md` and `project_implementation_plan.md`.

The ALL-USE system is a complex, multi-component application involving data pipelines, a core protocol engine, operations monitoring, reporting, and a web UI. A robust BDT framework is critical for managing this complexity.

## 2. BDT Philosophy

-   **Automation First:** Automate as much of the build, deployment, and testing processes as possible to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and ensure consistency.
-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines to enable frequent and reliable software releases.
-   **Shift Left:** Integrate testing and quality assurance activities early in the development lifecycle.
-   **Comprehensive Testing:** Employ a multi-layered testing strategy, including unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), performance, and security testing.
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage infrastructure components using code to ensure consistency, repeatability, and version control.
-   **Monitoring and Feedback:** Continuously monitor deployed applications and gather feedback to drive improvements.

## 3. BDT Workstreams and Phases

The BDT process is organized into three primary workstreams: Build, Deploy, and Test. Each workstream has distinct phases with specific objectives and deliverables. Detailed `implementation_prompt.md` files for each phase will be located in `all-use/workstreams/[BDT_Workstream_Name]/[Phase_Name]/`.

### 3.1. Build Workstream

**Goal:** To compile source code, manage dependencies, create runnable artifacts (e.g., Docker images, compiled binaries, frontend bundles), and ensure code quality through automated checks.

-   **Phase 1: Source Code Management & Initial CI Setup**
    -   **Description:** Establish Git repository structure, branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow), and initial CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated builds on code commits/PRs. Integrate linters and static code analysis (SAST basics).
    -   **Key Activities:** Setup Git, define branching model, configure CI server, integrate linters (e.g., Pylint, ESLint), basic SAST (e.g., Bandit, Snyk Code).
-   **Phase 2: Dependency Management & Containerization**
    -   **Description:** Implement robust dependency management for all components (Python, Node.js). Containerize each service/application component using Docker.
    -   **Key Activities:** Use `requirements.txt`/`pipenv` for Python, `package.json`/`npm`/`yarn` for Node.js. Develop Dockerfiles for each service. Set up a private Docker registry if needed.
-   **Phase 3: Advanced CI & Artifact Management**
    -   **Description:** Optimize CI build times (caching, parallel builds). Implement versioning for build artifacts. Store artifacts in a repository (e.g., Docker Hub, Nexus, Artifactory).
    -   **Key Activities:** CI pipeline optimization, artifact versioning strategy, integration with artifact repository.

### 3.2. Deploy Workstream

**Goal:** To reliably and efficiently deploy application artifacts to various environments (Development, Staging, Production).

-   **Phase 1: Environment Configuration & Management**
    -   **Description:** Define and manage configurations for different environments. Implement a secure way to handle secrets and environment-specific variables.
    -   **Key Activities:** Configuration management tools (e.g., environment files, HashiCorp Consul/Vault), secrets management strategy.
-   **Phase 2: Staging Deployment & CD Pipeline Setup**
    -   **Description:** Automate deployment to the Staging environment. Set up the initial Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline for Staging, triggered by successful CI builds.
    -   **Key Activities:** Develop deployment scripts (e.g., Docker Compose for Staging, Kubernetes manifests), integrate with CI/CD server, automated health checks post-deployment.
-   **Phase 3: Production Deployment & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
    -   **Description:** Implement deployment to Production (initially manual trigger, moving to automated). Introduce IaC (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for managing cloud infrastructure.
    -   **Key Activities:** Production deployment strategy (blue/green, canary), IaC for core infrastructure, rollback plans, production monitoring setup.

### 3.3. Test Workstream

**Goal:** To ensure the ALL-USE system meets functional requirements, performance targets, and security standards through comprehensive automated and manual testing.
*Note: The existing "Testing Infrastructure" workstream in ALL-USE (`all-use/docs/project_implementation_plan.md`, Section 2.1) has already completed significant work in this area. This BDT Test workstream will build upon and formalize those achievements within the iAI framework structure.*

-   **Phase 1: Unit & Integration Testing Setup & Enhancement**
    -   **Description:** Leverage and enhance existing unit and integration testing frameworks (PyTest, Jest/React Testing Library). Ensure comprehensive coverage for all new and existing critical components. Integrate fully into the CI pipeline.
    -   **Key Activities:** Review and augment existing tests, establish code coverage targets, ensure CI integration for all modules (Data Pipeline, Protocol Engine, Web UI, etc.).
-   **Phase 2: E2E & Security Testing Integration & Enhancement**
    -   **Description:** Leverage and enhance existing E2E testing (Selenium/Playwright). Integrate and expand automated security testing (SAST/DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
    -   **Key Activities:** Review and augment E2E test suites for critical user flows and system interactions. Expand SAST/DAST tool usage (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP) and integrate results into CI feedback.
-   **Phase 3: Performance & User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Execution**
    -   **Description:** Execute planned performance tests (load, stress) against the Staging environment. Conduct formal UAT with stakeholders to validate system functionality and usability.
    -   **Key Activities:** Use performance testing tools (e.g., k6, JMeter). Develop UAT scenarios, coordinate UAT sessions, collect and triage feedback.
-   **Phase 4: Advanced Testing & Continuous Improvement**
    -   **Description:** Implement advanced testing techniques (e.g., chaos engineering basics, more sophisticated security testing like fuzzing). Prepare for and coordinate external security audits/penetration tests. Continuously refine test strategies based on feedback and production incidents.
    -   **Key Activities:** Plan for external security audits, establish processes for addressing audit findings, explore advanced testing methods relevant to ALL-USE.

## 4. Tooling

-   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub)
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
-   **Containerization:** Docker
-   **Orchestration (Future):** Kubernetes
-   **IaC:** Terraform or CloudFormation (To be decided)
-   **Testing Frameworks:** PyTest, Jest, React Testing Library, Selenium/Playwright, k6/JMeter
-   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (as per `technical_architecture.md`)
-   **Artifact Repository:** Docker Hub, Nexus, or Artifactory (To be decided)

## 5. Integration with ALL-USE Workstreams

BDT processes are not isolated. They are integral to each development workstream (Data Pipeline, Protocol Engine, Web UI, etc.). Each workstream is responsible for developing and maintaining its own tests, ensuring its components are buildable and deployable, and adhering to this BDT framework.

## 6. Governance and Evolution

This BDT Framework will be a living document, reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in the ALL-USE project, new technologies, and evolving best practices. The `command_center_notes.md` for ALL-USE will track the implementation status of these BDT phases.
