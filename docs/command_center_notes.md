# ALL-USE Command Center Notes

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as the Command Center Notes for the ALL-USE project, aligning with the iAI Co-pilot Framework. It outlines project-specific coordination, refined implementation sequences, detailed workstream prioritization, parallelization strategies, module/component ordering, relationships, dependency management, design checkpoints, testing plans, and risk management. This document evolves from the initial outline in the `project_implementation_plan.md` and is actively maintained by the Command Center (Human Lead with AI Co-pilot support).

## 2. Project Coordination & Communication

-   **Primary Communication Channel:** This iAI Co-pilot chat thread.
-   **Source of Truth Repository:** `TKTINC/all-use-v2` GitHub repository.
-   **Key Documentation Links:**
    -   `docs/project_implementation_plan.md`
    -   `docs/technical_architecture.md`
    -   `docs/data_model_and_security.md`
    -   `onboarding_prompt.md` (root directory)
-   **Regular Checkpoints:** To be defined by the Human Lead. Initially, phase completion will serve as a major checkpoint.

## 3. Refined Implementation Sequence & Milestones

(This section will be updated as the project progresses. Initial sequence is based on the `project_implementation_plan.md`.)

**Current Focus:** Protocol Engine (Phase 2: Market Analysis & Week Classification).

**Next Major Milestones:**
1.  Completion of Protocol Engine - Phase 2.
2.  Initiation and completion of Operations & Monitoring - Phase 1 (Requirements & Strategy).
3.  Initiation and completion of Web UI - Phase 1 (UX/UI Design & Prototyping).

## 4. Detailed Workstream Prioritization, Parallelization, and Dependencies

(Refer to `project_implementation_plan.md` Section 7 for the high-level overview. This section provides more granular details and will be actively updated.)

### 4.1. Prioritization (Current View):

1.  **P0: Protocol Engine - Phase 2 (Market Analysis & Week Classification):** Actively in progress. Critical path for core functionality.
2.  **P1: Operations & Monitoring - Phase 1 (Requirements & Monitoring Strategy Definition):** Planning should start once Protocol Engine Phase 2 shows significant progress. Essential for future stability.
3.  **P1: Web UI - Phase 1 (UX/UI Design & Prototyping):** Can start in parallel with Ops & Monitoring planning. Defines user interaction.
4.  **P2: Protocol Engine - Phase 3 (Account Management & Strategy Implementation):** Dependent on completion of Phase 2.
5.  **P2: Reporting - Phase 1 (Reporting Requirements & Data Source Identification):** Planning can begin once Protocol Engine Phase 2 is well-defined.

### 4.2. Parallelization Opportunities:

-   **Current:** While Protocol Engine Phase 2 is the main development task, documentation refinement for completed workstreams (Testing Infrastructure, Data Pipeline) can occur.
-   **Upcoming:**
    -   Ops & Monitoring (Phase 1 Planning) can run parallel to late stages of Protocol Engine (Phase 2 Development).
    -   Web UI (Phase 1 Design) can run parallel to Ops & Monitoring (Phase 1 Planning).
    -   Reporting (Phase 1 Planning) can run parallel to Web UI (Phase 1 Design).

### 4.3. Module/Component Ordering & Relationships:

(Visualized as a dependency graph - to be potentially generated or maintained here)

-   **Data Pipeline** (Complete) -> Feeds -> **Protocol Engine**
-   **Testing Infrastructure** (Complete) -> Supports -> All other development workstreams.
-   **Protocol Engine** -> Feeds data/signals to -> **Web UI**, **Reporting**, **Feedback Loop**, **Operations & Monitoring**.
-   **Operations & Monitoring** -> Consumes data from -> All workstreams.
-   **Reporting** -> Consumes data from -> **Data Pipeline**, **Protocol Engine**, **Operations & Monitoring**.
-   **Feedback Loop** -> Consumes data from -> **Reporting**, **Protocol Engine**; Influences -> **Protocol Engine**.

### 4.4. Dependency Management (Key Current Dependencies):

-   **Protocol Engine - Phase 2** completion is a prerequisite for starting meaningful development on Phase 3, and for providing concrete data/APIs for Web UI, Reporting, and Feedback Loop initial development phases.
-   Definition of data schemas in `data_model_and_security.md` is critical for Data Pipeline consumers and Protocol Engine database interactions.
-   API contracts between Protocol Engine and other services (Web UI, Reporting) need to be defined early in the respective planning phases of those consumer services.

## 5. Design & Development Checkpoints

-   **End of Each Phase:** Major review and approval checkpoint. Deliverables for the phase must be complete and meet quality standards.
-   **API Definition Complete:** For services like Protocol Engine that expose APIs, a checkpoint to review and approve API contracts before consumer services start heavy development.
-   **UI/UX Design Approval:** For Web UI, a checkpoint after Phase 1 (Design & Prototyping) before full-scale frontend development.
-   **Security Model Review:** Before deploying components that handle sensitive data or external interactions.

## 6. Testing Plans (High-Level)

-   **Unit Tests:** Required for all new code in all workstreams. To be written by developers alongside feature implementation.
-   **Integration Tests:** Focus on interactions between components/services. Key integration points:
    -   Data Pipeline <-> Protocol Engine
    -   Protocol Engine <-> Web UI
    -   Protocol Engine <-> Reporting
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate full user scenarios or trading day scenarios. Will become more critical as more components are completed.
-   **Performance Tests:** For Data Pipeline, Protocol Engine, and Web UI under load.
-   **Security Testing:** Penetration testing (if applicable, especially for Web UI and external APIs), vulnerability scanning.

(Detailed test plans for each phase will be part of their `implementation_prompt.md` or separate test plan documents linked therein.)

## 7. Risk Management
